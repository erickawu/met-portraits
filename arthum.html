  <h1> The Face of the "Average" European Portrait </h1>
  <h2> Visualizing aesthetic changes of the human face in European portraiture in the Met Collection</h2>
<!--   <p> The archives at the Metropolitan Museum hold over 470,000 works,
    and the data and pictures of these objects can be accessed via the Met's publicly released API. 
    In light of our focus on the human form in Art Humanities, I wanted to observe the changes in how the human face 
    is depicted The Met's collection is split into several departments. 
    I took the average of each front-facing figure present in all works in the Met's department of European Paintings. </p> -->
